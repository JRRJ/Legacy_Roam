  [COMPLETE] Store completed roams with User and Date information


Add user history
  Easy, will require another page and new API route.
  The end result will list previous roams.

Add user photos
  easy but inconvenient way: use url.
  could also do react-native-image-picker, but where would we store the images?


Uber
  Potentially very difficult.  Lets give it a try, see how hard it is to test.
